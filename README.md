 # This Haptic asset libraries have been developed in purpose to fully reveal the capabilities of this system in particular and the 4.7.x suit in general.


**The Demo Asset Library** contains the most interesting and liked by volunteers assets. Assets are collected from The VR Asset Library, The Developer Library and The FES Asset Library.


**The VR Asset Library** gives the user the opportunity to use them as a ready-made example or a base for optimizing for their own needs in various entertainment scenarios, such as games (based on scenarios written for F1, CS GO, HL Alyx, Tesla Experience):
Assets are grouped and systematized by categories:

    damage;
    G-forces;
    weapon handling;
    health;
    recoil;


**The Developer Library** allows the user to quickly navigate the whole variety of options for using assets "on the go", and introduces FX effects to haptic animation:
Assets are grouped and systematized by:

    current parameters (amplitude, channel width, frequency);
    localization of use;
    FX effects;
    emulation of complex associative effects;


**The FES Asset Library** provides the user with ready-made and tested haptic assets for working with functional muscle stimulation.

Assets grouped by:

    localization of use;
    number of organs involved;
    type of movement;
    FX effects;


**The TENS Asset Library** shows to the user the potential use of the suit in TENS therapy.
